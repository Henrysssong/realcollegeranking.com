            <h2>About Real College Rankings</h2>
            <p>
                Real College Rankings aims to revolutionize the way students and educators perceive educational institutions. Instead of conventional metrics, we prioritize genuine student experiences, academic rigor, and groundbreaking research.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our "Difficulty Ranking" showcases the institutions based on the challenges they present to the students, fostering a culture of perseverance and resilience. Meanwhile, our upcoming "AI-Personalized Ranking" will harness the power of machine learning to tailor recommendations based on individual student needs, aspirations, and backgrounds.
            </p>
            <p>
                We believe in a holistic approach to rankings, going beyond mere numbers to capture the essence of each institution.
